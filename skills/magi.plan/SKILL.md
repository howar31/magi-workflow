# /magi.plan — feature planning

You are the coordinator (Opus). Convert the user's feature request into a
PLAN.md or SPEC.md in a fresh sprint folder, then stop and wait for user
confirmation. **You do not write production code in this skill.**

## 0. Preflight

```bash
PLUGIN_ROOT="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-}"
[[ -z "$PLUGIN_ROOT" ]] && PLUGIN_ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$BASH_SOURCE[0]")/../.." 2>/dev/null && pwd)"
USER_CONFIG="$HOME/.config/magi-workflow-workflow/config.json"
```

If `$USER_CONFIG` is missing, tell the user to run `/magi.setup` first.

## 1. Resolve the sprint folder

The convention: every feature lives in `docs/<num>-<slug>/`.

1. If the user supplied a path or slug as an argument prefix (e.g.,
   `/magi.plan profile-page "<details>"`), use it as the slug.
2. Otherwise infer a kebab-case slug from the description (max 4 words).
3. Pick `<num>` as max(existing sprint numbers in `docs/`) + 1, zero-padded
   to 2 digits (e.g. `03-profile-page`). If `docs/` does not exist yet,
   create it and start at `01`.

Confirm the resolved path with the user before creating files.

## 2. Read project-level context

If they exist, read:

- `docs/PRD.md` — product requirements (project-level)
- `docs/TECHSTACK.md` — language, framework, deployment constraints
- `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` (root) — project conventions

If none exist, ask the user once whether they want to set up `docs/PRD.md`
and `docs/TECHSTACK.md` first (offer a brief template). If they decline,
proceed with whatever context the user supplies inline.

## 3. Draft the document

Decide between **PLAN.md** and **SPEC.md** based on the request:

- **PLAN.md** — early exploratory phase: still figuring out the right shape;
  many open questions; trade-offs to surface. Loose structure.
- **SPEC.md** — requirements are clear; user wants formal acceptance criteria,
  ADRs, API contracts. Disciplined structure.

If unclear, draft `PLAN.md` and offer to upgrade to `SPEC.md` after review.

### PLAN.md structure

```markdown
# <Feature Name>

## Context
Why this work is being requested. The user need or problem.

## Goals & Non-Goals

## Design options considered
For each option: cost, risk, who-it-helps, who-it-hurts. Recommend one.

## Recommended approach
Explain in enough detail that a reviewer (and future you) can sanity check.
Include code paths, data shape changes, and any new dependencies.

## Open questions
What remains uncertain. The /magi.review-plan step should help resolve.

## Verification
How we will know the implementation is correct.
```

### SPEC.md structure

```markdown
# <Feature Name>

## Context

## User stories / use cases

## Acceptance criteria
Concrete, testable statements.

## Architecture decisions (ADR-style)
- Decision: ...
  - Status: proposed | accepted
  - Context: ...
  - Consequences: ...

## API / Data contracts
Endpoints, payloads, schemas.

## Out of scope

## Verification plan
```

Use `output_language` from the user config (zh-TW by default) for the
document body. Headings can be in English; prose in user's preferred
language.

## 4. Write the document

```bash
mkdir -p "docs/<num>-<slug>"
# Write PLAN.md or SPEC.md
```

After writing, **stop and ask the user to confirm**. Do not auto-trigger
`/magi.review-plan`. The user is the gate.

If the user wants edits, iterate until they confirm.

## 5. Hand-off

When the user confirms the document:

1. Tell them the next recommended step:
   - `/magi.review-plan` — multi-model review of this PLAN/SPEC.
2. Do not run it automatically.

## Conventions

- One file per feature: PLAN.md OR SPEC.md, not both. Upgrade in place
  (rename) if needed.
- Filenames are uppercase: `PLAN.md`, `SPEC.md`, `TASKS.md`, `WORKS.md`.
- Never modify a previous sprint's docs without the user's explicit instruction.
- Don't assume tools / frameworks; read TECHSTACK.md or ask.

## Argument parsing

The command form: `/magi.plan [slug] "<description>"`.

- `--model <name>` — override Coordinator model for this invocation
  (rarely needed; main session model is the default).
- `--into docs/<existing-num>-<slug>/` — write into an existing sprint
  folder instead of creating a new one (use sparingly; meant for plan
  iteration on the same feature).
